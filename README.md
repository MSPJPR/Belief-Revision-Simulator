# Belief-Revision-Simulator
website link: https://lnkd.in/gNFbdkdM

Description:
This project is a web-based application that allows users to manage and revise their beliefs dynamically. The system helps users add, delete, and revise beliefs while maintaining epistemic entrenchment hierarchies, handling uncertain information with possibility theory, and visualizing belief changes through interactive graphics. The application is designed to provide a smooth user experience with features like dark mode, conflict detection, and local storage support for persistence across sessions.

Core Features:
1. Belief Management:
Add beliefs with associated entrenchment levels (priority levels).

Delete individual beliefs.

Revise beliefs by removing those with the lowest entrenchment.

2. Epistemic Entrenchment Hierarchies:
Prioritize certain beliefs over others based on entrenchment levels.

Visualize beliefs in hierarchical order.

3. Possibility Theory Integration:
Handle uncertain beliefs using possibility distributions.

Reflect uncertainty in belief revision operations.

4. Conflict Detection:

Detect conflicting beliefs and prompt users for resolution.

5. Dynamic Visualization:

Use D3.js or SVG graphics to dynamically visualize belief states and revisions.

6. Dark Mode Toggle:

Switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.

7. Local Storage Support:

Save and load belief states to/from the browserâ€™s local storage to persist data across sessions.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structure and layout.

CSS3 for styling, including responsive design and dark mode support.

JavaScript (Vanilla) for core logic, belief revision operations, and dynamic updates.

D3.js or SVG for dynamic visualizations of belief hierarchies.

Local Storage for persistent data storage.

How It Works:

1. Adding a Belief:

Users enter a belief and assign an entrenchment level 

The belief is displayed in a list and visualized dynamically.

2. Revising Beliefs:

Clicking the "Revise Belief" button removes the belief with the lowest entrenchment level.

3. Conflict Detection:

When a conflicting belief is added, an alert notifies the user.

4. Dark Mode:

A toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark modes.

5. Local Storage:

Beliefs and theme preferences are saved, so they remain after refreshing or reopening the page.

Use Cases:

Educational Tool: Helps students understand belief revision principles and epistemic logic.

Decision-Making: Assists users in organizing and revising their thoughts logically.

Research: Useful for fields involving knowledge management, AI, and logic.

This project offers a comprehensive and interactive approach to understanding belief revision concepts, making it a valuable tool for education, research, and decision-making processes.
